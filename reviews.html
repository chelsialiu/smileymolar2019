          I just wanted to say a few things about Dr. Liu and his staff. I am a patient who came to his practice many, many, years ago. I had a very bad experience when I was a child, having to go to the dentist. I had a lot of fear. When I came to Dr. Liuâ€™s for a dental check-up, he and his staff put me at ease and made me feel very comfortable.</p>
        <p class="highlight-review">I no longer have a fear going for a check-up or any other dental work. He is such a caring dentist and he and his staff go over and above to make my check-ups and dental care a positive experience.</p>
      <p>He is always available if I need to see him for an emergency. I truly enjoy going for my check-ups because he really makes me feel comfortable. Just like family. Thanks Dr. Liu and your caring staff. &nbsp <img class="ending-quotes" src="./images/reviews-blue-quotes.png" alt="Quotes">&nbsp <em>~ Debbie</em></p>

      <p>He is very thorough and caught problems my other dentist seemed to overlook. He is on time and his staff, including those doing the cleaning, are very accommodating and friendly.

            For the past 20 or more years my trust for Dr. Liu and his team have continued to grow.
